# Pinball 2D
It is a project made by CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona. We are Pol Casaú and Xavi Marin and we hope you enjoy the game.

The original game is [here](https://www.classicgame.com/game/Metal+Pinball). The art and the sprites are extracted from there. 

The objective is to score as many points as possible trying to maintain the ball in the map. The game ends if the ball passes through the flippers that you will have to manage.
