# Pinball 2D
It is a project made by CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona. We are Pol Casaú and Xavi Marin and we hope you enjoy the game.

The art and the sprites of the game are extracted from this [website](https://www.classicgame.com/game/Metal+Pinball). 

The objective is to score as many points as possible trying to maintain the ball around the map. The game ends if the ball passes through the flippers that you will have to manage.
